## Introduction

This project aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for managing LLMs, from model conversion and training to deploying AI applications. The toolkit is based on the llama.cpp library and is designed to work seamlessly with it.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Llama-GGML Tools, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x (pip, venv)
- python3-is-python (if you need to)
- CUDA 10.2+ (recommend 11+, but >12 seems broken for xformers)
- nvcc   (usually comes with cuda and in CUDA_HOME/bin)

## Installation

To get started with Llama-GGML Tools, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llama-ggml-tools.git
cd llama-ggml-tools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Inference quick-start

To test a language model using the text-generation-ui, run the `chat.py` script. This script will install the following dependencies:

* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)
* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)

After the installation, you can interact with the language model through the text-generation-webui.

## Features

### Installers

Installers provide a set of scripts that automatically create virtual Python environments and set up all necessary dependencies for machine learning GitHub applications. These scripts simplify the installation process and ensure a consistent environment across projects.

### Launchers

The launchers are a set of scripts designed to initiate various AI applications. These launchers streamline the deployment process and provide an efficient way to manage AI-related tasks.

### Services

This part of the toolkit offers a collection of system services tailored for working on remote machines. These services facilitate the deployment and management of LLMs on remote servers, enabling seamless integration into existing infrastructure.

### Converters

This section contains a collection of scripts for converting between different LLM formats. These converters make it easy to work with various model formats and ensure compatibility with llama.cpp.

### Prompts

A collection of soft-prompts is available to simplify the process of interacting with LLMs. These prompts can be used as templates to generate custom text or to fine-tune models for specific use cases.

### Training

The training section includes a collection of scripts for training models. These scripts are designed to streamline the training process and make it easier to create and fine-tune custom LLMs.

## Usage

The Python LLM Tools are designed to help manage LLMs in various scenarios. Refer to each feature's specific documentation for detailed instructions on how to use the provided scripts.
