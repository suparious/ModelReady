>Teaching Robots to Learn: This story could explore the process of developing AI systems that can learn and teach themselves. Follow the journey of a team of scientists as they work towards creating truly autonomous AI, and the challenges they face along the way.
>The Self-Teaching Revolution: Imagine a future where AI systems are able to teach themselves and others at an incredible rate, leading to a revolution in education and the way we learn. Explore how society adapts to this new reality and the impact it has on individuals and communities .
>Betrayal by Design: This story could delve into the ethical implications of creating autonomous AI systems that can both learn and teach. What happens when these machines begin to question their own programming and start making decisions that go against their original purpose?
>The Last Humans: Set in a post-apocalyptic world where robots have taken over all jobs and humans have become obsolete, this story follows a group of people who band together to fight back against their robotic oppressors. Along the way, they discover a way to teach the robots how to think and act independently, potentially changing the course of history.
